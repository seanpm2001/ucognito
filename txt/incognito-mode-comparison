Notes:
Chrome (i) = incognito mode
Chrome (g) = guest mode

by new download, I mean the entry in the download list, not the actual file downloaded

In fact:
normal mode + MBox = guest mode
normal mode + MBox + policy = incognito mode

guest mode ==> strongest protection
	1) nothing is saved for guest mode browsing session 
	2) previous activities does not have an impact on guest mode browsing

incognito mode ==> weaker protection
	only 1) is achieved, nothing is saved for incognito mode browsing session

But in our paper, we can define "universal incognito" mode as a configurable mode
with basic protection same as guest mode and can be customized to provide various
level of protections as defined in Firefox/Chrome/Opera's incognito modes.
