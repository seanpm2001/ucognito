following are examples that violates the trace-hiding goal
in "incognito" mode:

1. HSTS supercookie - works on chrome, not on firefox

2. ETag - works on both chrome and firefox
http://lucb1e.com/rp/cookielesscookies/

Both can be blocked with our MBox approach, thus serves as
perfect motivating examples!

There is potentially a third way to track user with the <KEYGEN>
html tag. This is based on the fact that browser will store 
cert and keys in private browsing session without deleting them.
But we might need manual construction of the html form to prove it.
